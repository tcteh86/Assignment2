# Eligibility & Documentation
Applicants must provide valid government ID, latest three months of bank statements, and proof of employment. Self-employed borrowers need the latest tax return and business registration.

# Income & Debt-to-Income
Acceptable debt-to-income (DTI) is <= 40% for salaried applicants and <= 35% for self-employed. DTIs above 50% require mandatory manual review and typically decline unless secured with collateral.

# Credit Score Thresholds
Prime pricing applies for credit scores >= 720. Scores between 660-719 are near-prime and may be approved with higher rates. Scores < 640 typically require referral and compensating factors.

# Loan Purpose & Tenor
Debt consolidation and education loans allowed up to $80k. Renovation loans allowed up to $120k with contractor quote. Business-purpose loans for individuals require additional KYC and proof of business ownership.

# Policy Exceptions
Any override of DTI or credit thresholds must include documented rationale, supervisor approval, and explicit listing of mitigants. AI recommendations are advisory; human officers make the final decision.
